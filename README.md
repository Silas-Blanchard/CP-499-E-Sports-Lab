This repository is the capstone project for Silas Blanchard and Quinn Sebsoâ€”two seniors at Colorado College. Our program aims to address a fundamental problem with the Colorado College esports lab; there is no way to know how busy the lab is without being there. For many students, particularly in cold months, the walk to the lab could be a huge wasted effort if they find it to be full. Our project is a website, built using node js, that displays which computers are in use and which are free. Available to anyone on the colorado college campus (and using a colorado college network), this project is currently deployed and visitable at http://esportscomm.coloradocollege.edu

If you are on campus, visit today (we are proud of our work and want people to see it)

The project has three main parts: the website, the server, and the lab computers.

Installation and operation proceudres can be found here:

Modify port numbers in the files under /NEW PYW FILES to suit your needs. The default port is 12345 for our server, which is under Website/server

The project is currently maintained by @Silas-Blanchard and @qsebso on github
